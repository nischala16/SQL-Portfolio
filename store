#Create your own store! Your store should sell one type of things, like clothing or bikes, whatever you want your store to specialize in. 
#You should have a table for all the items in your store, and at least 5 columns for the kind of data you think you'd need to store. 

#You should sell at least 15 items, and use select statements to order your items by price and show at least one statistic about the items.
